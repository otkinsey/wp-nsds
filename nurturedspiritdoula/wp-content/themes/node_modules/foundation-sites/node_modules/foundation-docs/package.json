  "readme": "# Foundation Docs\n\nThis is a set of HTML templates and JavaScript utilities shared by the documentation pages for the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com) family of frameworks, including:\n\n- [Foundation for Sites](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites)\n- [Foundation for Apps](http://foundation.zurb.com/apps)\n- [Foundation for Emails](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails)\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install foundation-docs --save-dev\n```\n\n## JavaScript Usage\n\nWhen you `require()` the `foundation-docs` library, you get access to a handful of JavaScript libraries, as well as file paths to HTML templates.\n\n### foundationDocs.buildSearch\n\nGenerates a JSON file for use with the docs search function. Best used with the component tree generated by [Supercollider](https://github.com/gakimball/supercollider).\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `tree` (Object): tree of components to build pages from.\n- `cb` (Function): callback to run once the finished JSON file has been written to disk.\n\n```js\nvar foundationDocs = require('foundation-docs');\n\nfoundationDocs.buildSearch(supercollider.tree, cb);\n```\n\n### foundationDocs.handlebars\n\nAn instance of a custom Handlebars renderer with all the helpful functions we need to generate documentation.\n\n### foundationDocs.marked\n\nAn instance of a custom Marked renderer, which has two custom functions:\n- When headings are written, an anchor icon is added to the left of the heading text.\n- When code samples are written:\n  - If the language is `html_example`, a live rendering of the HTML in the sample is added.\n  - If the language is `inky_example`, a live rendering of the HTML in the sample&mdash;within an iframe that loads the Ink CSS&mdash;is added.\n\n### foundationDocs.componentTemplate\n\nA String path to the HTML template used for component pages. The general structure is:\n\n- Title area\n- Main docs (converted Markdown)\n- Sass reference\n- JavaScript reference\n- Table of contents\n\nThe path is `node_modules/foundation-docs/templates/component.html`.\n\n## Sass Usage\n\nThe CSS used for the Foundation documentation is included as a series of Sass partials. Foundation and Motion UI must be loaded manually before it.\n\n```scss\n@import 'foundation';\n@import 'motion-ui';\n\n@include foundation-everything;\n@include motion-ui-transitions;\n\n@import 'foundation-docs';\n```\n",
